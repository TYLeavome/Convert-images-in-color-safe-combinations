# Convert images in color safe combinations
An image processing program for biomedical researchers. 
Some journals require biomedical researchers to submit immunofluorescence images using magenta-green for contrast, not in a red-green mode, which may lead to confusion for people with red-green color deficiencies. 
This program could convert red immunofluorescence images or merged red-green immunofluorescence images in bulk to magenta pseudo color.
